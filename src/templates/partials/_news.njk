  </header>

  <div class="block-content">
    <p>In order to learn JavaScript and jQuery closer I've decided to develop a plugin. This is an image slider component, that makes a slideshow on a web-page. It's easy to install and use. It's already used on this web-site, see the top block. For more information, please refer <a href="/apps.html#swypeslider">this page</a>.</p>

  </header>

  <div class="block-content">
    <p>Site development continues. I've selected technology stack for this development iteration.
Here are list of the technologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> for styles, because it's easy to learn and really powerfull;</li>
      <li><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a template engine for HTML. First I thought about AngularJS as a framework for the site, but now I think it's a bit of overkill. Nunjucks on the otherhand has everything I need: macroses, partials, for-each loops and variables;</li>
      <li>As for icons I've chosen <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a>, because it's awesome;</li>
      <li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> as a build system. It has tons of plugins and syntax that is easy to comprehend (I like that code over configuration idea);</li>
      <li>For frontend dependancies managment I chose <a href="https://bower.io/">Bower</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This report got it's main goal to check the layout of the news block.</p>
